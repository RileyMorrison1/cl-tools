## How to Make Commands
A user can make a new command in most Linux distributions by editing the <b>~/.bashrc</b> file. You will need to add a new line to the file and write:

> alias <command_name>='<path_to_tool>'

Make sure to replace <command_name> with the name you wish to call the command and replace <path_to_tool> with the path to the specific tool.
Also make sure not to name the command after a command that already exists, or it will replace it until the line is removed.
